# andropogon_snpModels

This repository contains code for modeling the spatial distribution of bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of *Andropogon gerardii*, the dominant grass in the North American tallgrass prairie. Collaborators include Loretta Johnson and Jacob Alsdurf (Kansas State University). The code uses R packages available on CRAN and the `omnibus`, `enmSdm`, `legendary`, `statisfactory`, and `fasterRaster` packages available from this account (adamlilith).

All code is supplied for educational purposes only.
